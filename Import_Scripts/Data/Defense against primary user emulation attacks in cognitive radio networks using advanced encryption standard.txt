AES-assisted DTV scheme

We propose a reliable AES-assisted DTV scheme , in which an AES-encrypted reference signal is generated at the TV transmitter and used as the sync bits of the DTV data frames .
In addition , when combined with the analysis on the autocorrelation of the received signal , the presence of the malicious user can be detected accurately whether or not the primary user is present .
We analyze the effectiveness of the proposed approach through both theoretical analysis and simulation examples .
It should be emphasized that the proposed scheme requires no changes in hardware or system structure except for a plug-in AES chip .
