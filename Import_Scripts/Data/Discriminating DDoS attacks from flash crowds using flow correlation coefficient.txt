flow correlation coefficient

Based on this , we proposed a discrimination algorithm using the flow correlation coefficient as a similarity metric among suspicious flows .
We formulated the problem , and presented theoretical proofs for the feasibility of the proposed discrimination method in theory .
Our extensive experiments confirmed the theoretical analysis and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in practice . © 1990-2012 IEEE .
