Wormhole 100.00%

probability distribution of the neighboring-node-number

We present a wormhole attack detection approach based on the probability distribution of the neighboring-node-number , WAPN , which helps the sensor nodes to judge distributively whether a wormhole attack is taking place and whether they are in the influencing area of the attack .
Finally , we propose a simple method to obtain the threshold number , which is used to detect the existence of a wormhole .
