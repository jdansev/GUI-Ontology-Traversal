Youn and Lim in 2010 proposed an improved delegation-based authentication protocol to add the unlinkability property for protecting user 's privacy .
The denial of service ( DoS ) threats on Youn and Lim , and multiple VLRs have also been considered .
The proposed protocol is specially suitable for off-line fast payments and provides buyer 's privacy by applying anonymity and unlinkability techniques .
