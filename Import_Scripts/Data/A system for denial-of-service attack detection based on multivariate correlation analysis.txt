multivariate correlation analysis ( MCA )

In this paper , we present a DoS attack detection system that uses multivariate correlation analysis ( MCA ) for accurate network traffic characterization by extracting the geometrical correlations between network traffic features .
Furthermore , a triangle-area-based technique is proposed to enhance and to speed up the process of MCA .
The effectiveness of our proposed detection system is evaluated using KDD Cup 99 data set , and the influences of both non-normalized data and normalized data on the performance of the proposed detection system are examined .
