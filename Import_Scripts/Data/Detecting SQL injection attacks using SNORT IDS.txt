SNORT IDS

In this paper we propose an innovative solution to filter the SQL injection attack using SNORT IDS .
The proposed detection technique uses SNORT tool by augmenting a number of additional SNORT rules .
We evaluate the proposed solution by comparing our method with several existing techniques .
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other similar techniques using the same data set . © 2014 IEEE .
