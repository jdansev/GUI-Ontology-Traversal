Snort-IDS

In this paper , we present the procedure to improve the Snort-IDS rules for the network probe attack detection .
Firstly , we analyzed and explored the existing the Snort-IDS rules to improve the proposed Snort-IDS rules .
As the experimental results , the proposed Snort-IDS efficiently detected the network probe attacks compared to the Detection Scoring Truth .
