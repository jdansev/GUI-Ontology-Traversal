DoS 100.00%

composition self-similarity anomaly detection ( CSSD ) method

We propose the concept of composition distribution graph and design the relative operations .
Based on composition distribution graph and Kullback Leibler ( KL ) divergence , we propose the composition self-similarity anomaly detection ( CSSD ) method for the detection of DoS attacks .
We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method .
