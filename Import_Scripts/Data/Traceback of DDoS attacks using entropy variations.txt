DDoS 100.00%

traceback method

In this paper , we propose a novel traceback method for DDoS attacks that is based on entropy variations between normal and DDoS attack traffic , which is fundamentally different from commonly used packet marking techniques .
In comparison to the existing DDoS traceback methods , the proposed strategy possesses a number of advantagesit is memory nonintensive , efficiently scalable , robust against packet pollution , and independent of attack traffic patterns .
The results of extensive experimental and simulation studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method .
