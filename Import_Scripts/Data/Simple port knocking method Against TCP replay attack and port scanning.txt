Source Port sequences

This project proposes a new approach over the existing Port Knocking by employing the Source Port sequences that will simplify a technique for port knocking system .
The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by measuring the authentication time to knock the server .
As a result , the proposed method worked faster than other methods like basic port knocking and Fwknop + SPA .
This has shown that the proposed method was simple and at the same time against the TCP replay attack and port scanning . © 2012 IEEE .
