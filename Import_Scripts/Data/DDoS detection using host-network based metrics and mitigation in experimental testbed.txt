Interface Based Rate Limiting ( IBRL ) algorithm

Based on the assumption that the attacker flows are very aggressive than the legitimate users the proposed work provides sufficient bandwidth to genuine users during flooding DDoS attack .
The Interface Based Rate Limiting ( IBRL ) algorithm proposed in this paper is used to mitigate the identified DDoS attacks .
