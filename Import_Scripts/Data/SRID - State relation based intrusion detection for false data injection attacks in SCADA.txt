injection 100.00%

relation-graph-based detection scheme

Several intrusion detection schemes have been proposed previously [ 1 , 2 ] .
In this paper , we propose a new relation-graph-based detection scheme to defeat false data injection attacks at the SCADA system , even when injected data may seemly fall within a valid/normal range .
Furthermore , we propose a new inference algorithm to infer the injection point ( s ) , i.e. , the attack origin , in the system .
