RSA-based framework

In this paper , we propose a novel RSA-based framework for combating DoS attacks in WSN by ensuring that the malicious party will exhaust its resources prior to exhausting those of its counterparts .
Under the proposed approach , the mathematical operations performed by the malicious party require two or three orders of magnitude more resources than those required by the attacked party .
We also present three methodologies for establishing an ephemeral key , in which the proposed DoS mitigation mechanism is an embedded component .
