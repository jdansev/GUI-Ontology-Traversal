K-means cluster analysis

The traditional approach to address sybil attacks is to employ cryptographic-related methods .
In this paper , we propose to utilize K-means cluster analysis for detecting sybil attacks based on the spatial correlation between the signal strength and physical locations .
Our results show that the proposed sybil attack detector is highly effective with over 95 % detection rates and under 5 % false positive rates . © 2008 IEEE .
