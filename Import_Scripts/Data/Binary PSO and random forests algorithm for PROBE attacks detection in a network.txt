binary particle swarm optimization ( BPSO ) and random forests ( RF ) algorithm

Different classification techniques for identifying various attacks have been proposed in the literature .
In this paper we propose and implement a hybrid classifier based on binary particle swarm optimization ( BPSO ) and random forests ( RF ) algorithm for the classification of PROBE attacks in a network .
We also compare the performance of our proposed classifier with eight other well-known classifiers and the results show that the performance achieved by the proposed classifier is much better than the other approaches . © 2011 IEEE .
