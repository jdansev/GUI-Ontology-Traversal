DDoS 100.00%

JUST-Google

In this paper , we propose a simple yet effective scheme that enables an ISP 's edge routers to pass a great percentage of legitimate traffic , that is destined to a web server under DDoS attack within that ISP , while filtering all other traffic .
The proposed scheme , called JUST-Google , is based on the fact that web search engines ( especially Google™ ) represent the entrance for today 's web , thus making it in a strategic position to defend against these attacks .
Performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme would enable legitimate clients to access a web site that is under attack with high probability . ©2009 IEEE .
