Marking on Demand ( MOD ) scheme

We therefore propose a novel Marking on Demand ( MOD ) scheme based on the DPM mechanism to dynamical distribute marking IDs in both temporal and space dimensions .
The proposed MOD scheme can traceback to all possible sources of DDoS attacks , which is not possible for the existing DPM schemes .
We thoroughly compare the proposed MOD scheme with two dominant DPM schemes through theoretical analysis and experiments .
