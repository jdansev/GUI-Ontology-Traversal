multiagent pattern recognition mechanism

In this study , the authors propose a multiagent pattern recognition mechanism for detecting DDoS attacks , in adistributed fashion .
Our proposed solution is very effective in detecting such attacks launched against victim servers residing inside a production network which has multiple gateways to the Internet .
Using simulation , the authors show that our proposed mechanism achieves a high degree of accuracy in detecting DDoS attacks , with low false alarm rates , using a reasonable numbers of attack detection agents collaboratively operating in a typical production network .
